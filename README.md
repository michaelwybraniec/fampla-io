This repository contains the source code for the remastered [Vue.js 3 Masterclass](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class) course on 05/2022 by [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwybraniec/) ([michaelwybraniec@me.com](michaelwybraniec@me.com))

The Vue.js Masterclass is so comprehensive that we **can not cover everything on this page**. Thus weâ€™ve created a [separate page](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class) where you can learn more about it.

The goal was to master skills along with Best Practices, Modern Javascript, and other exciting technologies, by building a Real World application - a forum.

### Project Fundamentals:

- Vue cli, router, and State management with Vuex
- Modern Javascript (ES6/7/8)
- User permissions & Route Guards
- Third party authentication
- Google Cloud Firestore
- Automatic code review with ESLint
- Consuming REST API
- Application architecture and best practices

### Harder topics:

- Higher Order Functions
- Creating Vue Plugins
- Code Splitting
- Support for older Browsers
- Webpack configuration
- SEO and pre-rendering
- Deployments
