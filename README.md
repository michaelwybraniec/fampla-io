This repository contains the source code for the remastered [Vue.js 3 Masterclass](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class) course on 05/2022 by [Mike](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelwybraniec/) ([michaelwybraniec@me.com](michaelwybraniec@me.com))

The Vue.js Masterclass is so comprehensive that we **can not cover everything on this page**. Thus we’ve created a [separate page](https://vueschool.io/the-vuejs-master-class) where you can learn more about it.
